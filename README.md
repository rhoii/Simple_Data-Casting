# Simple_Data-Casting

This Java program demonstrates simple data casting from an `int` to a `double`. It converts an integer value into a double and prints the result.

## How It Works
1. The program initializes an integer variable `num`.
2. It then casts `num` to a `double` type and stores it in `myDouble`.
3. Finally, it prints the result, showing the conversion from `int` to `double`.
